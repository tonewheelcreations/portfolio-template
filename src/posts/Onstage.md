## Executive Summary

The testing evaluated the usability of a high-fidelity prototype of a music live-streaming app called Onstage. I tested 5 participants remotely via moderated Zoom sessions. There were 3 broad goals: to ensure that each red route of the MVP made sense to the user, to evaluate ease of use and interaction (e.g. navigating and switching between states), and to gauge the user’s reception of the visual design. Users completed 9 activities, organized within the three red routes. Throughout testing, I recorded participants’ verbal feedback, my own observations about the ease or difficulty of activities, and participants’ satisfaction while completing activities. Overall, all users completed 100% of the activities successfully. Common challenges were searching for a concert by date, setting artist preferences, and adjusting audio and video settings.

## Methodology

### Participants

#### How participants were selected

Via recruitment screener posted on social media and work slack channel

#### Who was tested

5 participants with the following attributes:

-   Familiarity with music streaming services (e.g. Spotify, Pandora)
    
-   Have previously attended ticketed live concerts
    
-   Have watched recorded concerts or live concerts remotely
    

#### What participants did

4 background questions and 9 activities within 3 red routes for the MVP of Onstage

  

### Background Questions

1.  What’s your occupation currently?
    
2.  What kind of mobile device (or devices) do you use, like smartphones or a tablet?
    
3.  What kinds of things do you spend time doing on your mobile devices?
    
4.  Do you have any favorite mobile apps?
    

  

### Activities

#### Set up account and musical preferences

5.  Imagine you just downloaded the app. You’re a fan of classical and jazz music. Can you create an account and set up your preferences based on those interests?
    
6.  Now you’ve decided you’re only interested in jazz music. Can you update your preferences and change that?
    

#### Find and purchase a concert

7.  You want to find a jazz concert to watch this week, but the only date you’re free is January 16th. How would you go about finding the concert?
    
8.  You are interested in watching this concert. What would you do?
    
9.  You’ve changed your mind last minute and just want to watch the John Mayer trio instead. How would you go about only purchasing that concert?
    

#### Watch a concert

10.  Now that you’ve bought the John Mayer Trio concert, how would you view it on your phone?
    
11.  You want to browse and find some other concerts to watch but have the concert playing in the background. How would you do that?
    
12.  You like the concert, but you want to tweak the sound and video. How would you make it sound more acoustic?
    
13.  How would you make it look and feel as if you’re there in the venue?
    

  

## Findings

### Issue #1

The layout of the search page confused most participants and it was particularly unclear how to find a concert for a specific date

#### Summary:

-   3 participants unsure of where to search for concerts
    
-   All participants struggled to find date filter when searching
    
-   2 participants looked for concerts under “Watch” tab instead of in “Explore” section of “Search” tab
    

#### Recommendations:

-   Consider renaming headings on the main search page
    
-   Redesign the search flow to better indicate how to search for concerts by genre
    
-   Place date filter at the top of the search page hierarchy
    

  

### Issue #2

It was not immediately clear that this app provides video live-streams of musical concerts.

#### Summary:

-   2 participants thought the app provided pre-recorded music
    
-   2 participants found no indication of live music in the app
    
-   “Watch” tab seemed more like a search area than a streaming video-playing area
    

#### Recommendations:

-   Update visual design throughout app to provide clues of live-streaming purpose
    
-   Make concert tickets indicate that they’re for watching a concert
    

  

### Issue #3

It was difficult to find musical preferences within the app after onboarding.

#### Summary:

-   All participant expected audio and video settings to be available within video player
    
-   2 participants could not remember location of settings icon
    

#### Recommendations:

-   Make settings icon available on video player
    
-   Add separate audio and video icons to open modals for audio and video preferences directly in video player
