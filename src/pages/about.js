                <p>Hi, I’m Leo. I’m a UX Designer who helps bring people together by sharing stories. As a musician turned designer, I believe that connecting people to a story leads to the most meaningful experiences -- it creates community.
                I’ve always wanted to be a storyteller throughout my childhood. This led me to become a jazz musician. For nearly 12 years, I wrote my own story in New York City. There, I learned how to connect emotionally with diverse groups of people, in many a smoky jazz club (minus the smoke). I had my big break when I released my first album, which reached over 1 million listeners.</p>

                <p>In addition to music, I’ve worked as a videographer and sound designer, helping artists and organizations increase their social media metrics by over 200% and gain nearly 10,000 unique viewers. My audiovisual work has been featured by audio industry giants like Moog Synthesizers and popular events platforms like Fever.
                Other than that, I enjoy traveling, mushroom hunting, and photography -- all after a cup of home-roasted coffee.</p>

                <p>I graduated from Columbia University with a degree in education. I’m currently based in and originally from Baltimore.
                Thanks for reading.</p>
